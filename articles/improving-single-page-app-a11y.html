<p>Sometimes a design calls for a complex component that is difficult to understand, operate...</p>
<p>Create a help system that uses a common keyboard shortcut(ctrl-H). When a component with help text available is focused, the element will state the &quot;help text is available&quot;. When the user presses the shortcut, a script will detect which item is currently focused and announce its help text.</p>
