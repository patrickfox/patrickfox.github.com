<h2 data-page-title="Accessible Modals">Accessible Modals</h2>


<p>Building accessible modals is easy. A few things to keep in mind:</p>
<h3 id="add-role-dialog-to-modal">Add role=dialog to modal</h3>
<p>Outer modal container must have a <code>role=&quot;dialog&quot;</code>. When focus is placed on or inside the modal, screen readers will announce a &quot;dialog&quot;.</p>
<h3 id="use-h1-as-the-first-heading">Use H1 as the first heading</h3>
<p>Since the modal is the only active item in the page, use headings starting at H1 to indicate to the user that this is the highest level heading.</p>
<h3 id="use-aria-labelledby-to-label-the-modal">Use aria-labelledby to label the modal</h3>
<p>Provide context for the prupose of the modal by using aria-labelledby to assocaite the modal with a heading or other content that speaks to its purpose.</p>
<h3 id="isolate-the-modal-from-the-rest-of-the-ui">Isolate the modal from the rest of the UI</h3>
<p>This technique relies on aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; to hide the main page content, and a focus listener that returns focus to the modal if the page receives focus.</p>
<h3 id="place-focus-on-first-focusable-element">Place focus on first focusable element</h3>
<p>The first focusable element inside the modal should receive focus.</p>
<h3 id="listen-for-escape-key-to-close-modal">Listen for escape key to close modal</h3>
<p>Ability to close modal via the Escape key on informative modals. <em>Note: If a modal requires user input to proceed, the Escape key behavior should be disabled.</em></p>
